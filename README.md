# Binomial Pricing Trees in R

This script constructs a recombining tree for pricing vanilla European and American options and (optionally) outputs the tree in a format suitable for plotting with `graphviz`. The code is written for clarity. New payoff functions can be easily added. For a detailed explanation and more examples, see [this blog post](http://www.frolovs.me/2016/05/26/binomial-pricing-trees-in-R.html).
